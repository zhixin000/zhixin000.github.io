        <p>Starting a project is the beginning—an origin point that contains no technical complexity, yet determines the project’s true value: whether it responds to a real human problem. But in the university evaluation system, we were trained to calculate “return on investment”: Can this research produce a paper? Will this competition award help with graduate school admission? We became adept at using a merit-based ruler to measure every opportunity, yet rarely asked ourselves the simplest question: Why am I doing this?</p>

      <p>I was once a loyal follower of that logic. During my freshman year, I chased high GPAs, stacked shiny but repetitive résumé labels, and tried to polish myself into the most flawless puzzle piece that matched the standard application mold. It wasn’t until I failed a so-called “mentor research program”—a project designed entirely for publication—that something finally broke. I executed commands mechanically, detached from the work itself. That failure forced me to pause and confront a question I should have asked from the very beginning: Why do I want to become an electronic engineer?</p>

      <p>Looking back on my brief university years, one memory resurfaced clearly: in a community rehabilitation center, a little autistic girl named Huihui once drew a tiny sun in the center of my palm. That silent gesture was her attempt to connect with the world. I realized that I was never obsessed with technology alone, nor solely with artistic expression. I was drawn to something in between. I enjoyed building order in the logical world of code, but could just as easily be moved by the narrative power of an exhibition’s visual language. This “split identity” once confused me, but in that moment, clarity emerged.</p>

          <div class="story-body">
      <p>I began to understand that my place might lie in the intersection. Could my engineering skills become a bridge to interpret subtle expressions like Huihui’s little sun? Compared with traditional developers, I wanted to infuse engineering with artistic sensitivity and a deeper understanding of human emotions. Compared with artists, I had the technical grounding to bring ideas into reality. And compared with engineers focused purely on execution, I felt compelled to observe society and identify the “real problems” worth solving.</p>

      <p>Once I understood this, my standard for what defines a “good project” transformed completely. A good project no longer meant a glossy transcript entry—it became an earnest question. It began with a simple curiosity: Can I use a blend of technology and artistic expression to reveal the inner worlds of autistic children, worlds that are often overlooked? When technology becomes a brush for storytelling, and engineering becomes a scaffold for empathy, a project gains a soul.</p>

      <p>From that moment, I was no longer just an executor. I began to look for inspiration in real human connections—especially from children like Huihui. I came to believe that the quality of a project is often determined long before the first line of code is written. Its origin—the intention rooted in real life, in real people—is what gives it meaning.</p>
